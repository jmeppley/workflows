7. HOW TO CITE RFAM

1. Rfam is a database of structure-annotated multiple sequence alignments,
convariance models and family annotation for a number of non-coding RNA,
cis-regulatory and self-splicing intron families. Rfam 14.0 contains 2,791
families. The seed alignments are hand curated and aligned using available
sequence and structure data, and covariance models are built from these
alignments using the INFERNAL v1.1.2 software suite (http://infernal.janelia.org).
The full regions list is created by searching the RFAMSEQ database (described
below) using the covariance model, and then listing all hits above a family
specific threshold to the model. Rfam 14.0 annotates a total of 2,917,933 
regions in the RFAMSEQ database. The annotations are based on a collection 
of 14,434 reference genomes, provided by Uniprot proteomes. 

Rfam is maintained by a consortium of researchers at the EMBL European
Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, UK), Sean Eddy's laboratory 
(Harvard University, USA) and Eric Nawrocki (NIH, USA).
We are very keen to hear any feedback, positive or negative, that you 
may have on Rfam - please contact rfam-help@ebi.ac.uk.

3. NOTABLE CHANGES IN RECENT RELEASES

Release 14.1
------------

(0) Rfam 14.1 is a point release of Rfam 14.0 making available 226 families with the total number of 
Rfam families adding up to 3,016. In addition, we now display pseudoknots supported by the latest 
R-scape version 1.2.2. The two main sources of pseudoknots are: manual annotation of pseudoknots in 
SEED alignments and R-scape predictions. 

(1) This new release comprises 226 new families from 5 distinct ncRNA types which are listed below:
	
	* 56	Cis-reg;
	* 2	Cis-reg; leader;
	* 5	Cis-reg; riboswitch;
	* 4	Gene; antisense;
	* 159	Gene; sRNA;

(2) Additional 3D structures were identified for 11 families.

(3) Families RF02440 (ldcC RNA) and RF02840 (Lacto-3 RNA) have been updated using the SEED alignments
provided by Dr Zasha Weinberg.


From release 14.0
-----------------

(0) Rfam 14.0 is another major release following the transition to the genome-centric
sequence database. This new release makes available genome annotations on slightly over 
10,000 species with the addition of 6,519 new species since release 13.0.

(1) This new release comprises 105 new families from 8 distinct ncRNA types which are listed below:
	
	* 1     Cis-reg;
	* 1     Cis-reg; leader;
	* 1     Cis-reg; riboswitch;
	* 4     Cis-reg; thermoregulator;
	* 17    Gene; antisense;
	* 5     Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;
	* 11    Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;
	* 65    Gene; sRNA;

(3) Additional structures were identified for 17 families and three new structures were made 
available one for each family DnaX (RF00382), HIV_PBS (RF00375) and Pab160 (RF02796).  


From release 13.0
-----------------
(0) Rfam 13.0 is the first major release after 12.0. This release brings back Rfam genomes 
with a renovated web interface that comes with many new features.

(1) There are no new families in this release apart from the deletion of RF00871 (mir-689)
following its suppression by miRBase.

(2) Rfam models have been enhanced with the addition of GO terms in 260 more families. 

(3) All seed sequences have been inherited from the old sequence database, therefore the 
models remained intact. 

(4) New website features have become available, including genome and sequence browsing. 


From release 12.3
-----------------

(0) Rfam 12.3 is another point release of Rfam 12.0 with the addition of 101 new families
to those released in 12.2. The release procedure followed was as in its preceding releases 
Rfam 12.0, 12.1 and 12.2.

(1) 101 new Rfam families have been added to Rfam the types of which may be broken down
as follows:

	* 5	Cis-reg;
	* 1	Cis-reg; riboswitch;
	* 21	Cis-reg; thermoregulator;
	* 8	Gene; antisense; 
	* 1	Gene; ribozyme;
	* 7	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box
	* 1	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box
	* 2	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;
	* 5	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; scaRNA
	* 1	Gene; sRNA
	* 49	Gene; sRNA;

(2) From this release onwards clan competition will also be applied on pdb annotations
to reduce family annotation duplicates on pdb sequences as well. 

(3) New website features have become available with this release. A new unified text 
search aims at simplifying searching and users are now able to download unaligned 
family sequences directly from the family pages.   

(4) The file used for clan competition will be named Rfam.clanin from this release onwards.
This is the equivalent of Rfam12.2.claninfo provided in the previous release.

6. GENOME ANNOTATION

The Rfam library of covariance models can be used to search sequences
(including whole genomes) for homologues to known non-coding RNAs, in
conjunction with the INFERNAL software. From this release onwards, Rfam 
will be providing annotations on a continuously increasing collection of
reference genomes, imported from various resources such as Uniprot, Ensembl, 
Ensembl Genomes and NCBI. For more information on how to annotate genomes 
and RNA sequences, please read "Genome annotation" section on Rfam Help
(http://rfam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genome-annotation.html). 


7. RFAMSEQ

RFAMSEQ is majorly built from a small fragment of the EMBL nucleotide Archive (ENA). 
As ENA grew almost one order of magnitude larger in size, instead of using the STD 
and WGS data classes, Rfam now "filters" those a step further, by focusing only on 
reference genomes provided by Uniprot. The current version of RFAMSEQ release 14.0 
is composed of a total of 14,451 genomes and it will keep increasing continuously 
with new species added to the genome collection.
