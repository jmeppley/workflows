7. HOW TO CITE RFAM

1. Rfam is a database of structure-annotated multiple sequence alignments,
convariance models and family annotation for a number of non-coding RNA,
cis-regulatory and self-splicing intron families. Rfam 12.1 contains 2473
families. The seed alignments are hand curated and aligned using available
sequence and structure data, and covariance models are built from these
alignments using the INFERNAL 1.1 software suite (http://infernal.janelia.org).
The full regions list is created by searching the RFAMSEQ database (described
below) using the covariance model, and then listing all hits above a family
specific threshold to the model. Rfam 12.1 annotates 19,639,727 regions in the
RFAMSEQ database.

Rfam is maintained by a consortium of researchers at the EMBL European
Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK and the Howard Huges Medical Institute,
Janelia Farm Research Campus, Ashburn, Virginia, USA. We are very keen to hear
any feedback, positive or negative, that you may have on Rfam - please contact
rfam-help@ebi.ac.uk.

Rfam is freely available and in the public domain under the Creative Commons
Zero licence. See ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT/COPYING for
more information.

3. NOTABLE CHANGES IN RECENT RELEASES

Release 12.1
------------

(0) Rfam 12.1 is a point release of Rfam 12.0 with the addition of 20 new families,
following the same procedure as in Rfam 12.0. 

(1) 20 new Rfam families have been added to Rfam the types of which may be broken down 
as follows:
 * 3  Cis-reg;
 * 4  Gene; antisense;
 * 2  Gene; rRNA;
 * 11 Gene; sRNA;



From release 12.0
-----------------

(0) Rfam 12.0 was built using INFERNAL v1.1. In order to migrate from using
Infernal 1.0, all families had to be manually rethresholded. Therefore there may
have been some significant gains/losses in families when compared with Rfam
11.0. The BLAST prefilters have now been entirely replaced by the internal
HMM-based filters of INFERNAL. 

(1) 329 new Rfam families have been added to Rfam. The majority of these are
bacterial sRNAs. Of particular interest are the new LSU models for archaea,
bacteria and eukaryotes. Types of the new families may be broken down as follows:
  * 31  Cis-reg;
  * 3   Cis-reg; IRES;
  * 4   Cis-reg; leader;
  * 2   Cis-reg; thermoregulator;
  * 7   Gene;
  * 2   Gene; antitoxin;
  * 25  Gene; lncRNA;
  * 13  Gene; miRNA;
  * 5   Gene; ribozyme;
  * 4   Gene, rRNA;
  * 45  Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;
  * 40  Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; HACA-box;
  * 4   Gene; snRNA; splicing;
  * 144 Gene; sRNA;

(2) We have removed 22 families from the database. Some families did not survive
the upgrade to Infernal 1.1. Several lncRNA families have been removed due to
their position within introns. Details for each family are below:

  * RF01017 (mir-625)     Unspecific model
  * RF01063 (mir-324)     Unspecific model
  * RF01112 (UPD-PKg)     Unspecific model
  * RF01115 (TMV_UPD-PK2) Unspecific model
  * RF01148 (sR13)        Merged into RF00095
  * RF01311 (sR8)         Merged into RF01133
  * RF01372 (CRISPR-DR59) Merged into RF01340
  * RF01868 (NAMA_1)      Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01869 (NAMA_2)      Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01870 (MEG3_1)      Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01878 (PRINS)       Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01893 (PCA3_1)      Intronic lncRNA 
  * RF01907 (HOTAIR_4)    Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01908 (HOTAIR_5)    Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01958 (EGOT)        Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01961 (KCNQ1DN)     Intronic lncRNA
  * RF01980 (Nkx2-2as)    Intronic lncRNA
  * RF02152 (MIMT1_2)     Intronic lncRNA
  * RF02361 (Yfr9)        Merged into RF02360
  * RF02380 (csRNA2)      Merged into RF02379
  * RF02381 (csRNA3)      Merged into RF02379
  * RF02382 (csRNA4)      Merged into RF02379
  * RF02383 (csRNA5)      Merged into RF02379

(3) As of Rfam 12.0, we no longer provide FULL alignments for each family. As
the size of our full alignments grew, the overheads involved in creating,
storing and manipulating them became too great to support. Instead, we provide
full region lists, which contain the ENA sequence accession, start/end
coordinates and bitscore for each hit to a family. If you wish to build a FULL
alignment equivalent to those supplied in previous releases of Rfam, you may do
so by downloading the CM for a given family and the Rfam sequence database,
RFAMSEQ (or indeed you may choose to use your own set of sequences). This means
that some sections of the website are no longer available, such as the option to
download or view the full alignment for a given family.

(4) Secondary structures have been removed from lncRNA families due to lack of
supporting evidence

From release 11.0
-----------------

(1) 246 new Rfam families have been added to Rfam. The majority of
    these new families are lncRNA and bacterial sRNAs. Counts for the
    new families break down into the following types:
     
     *	7	Cis-reg;
     *	23	Gene;
     *	1	Gene; antisense;
     *	1	Gene; antitoxin;
     *	144	Gene; lncRNA;
     *	11	Gene; miRNA;
     *	2	Gene; ribozyme;
     *	1	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;
     *	56	Gene; sRNA;


(2) We have introduced two new sub categories to our family type
    classifications. The new types have been used for new families and for
    the reclassification of existing families. The new types are:
    
    * Gene; antitoxin; 
    * Gene; lncRNA; 

(3) 11 families have been removed from the database. Details of the
    families and reasons for their removal are given below:

    3 families : RF00491 (SVLPA), RF01058 (MIR806) and RF01062
    (MIR812) were nonspecific models which we were unable to improve.

    1 family: RF01110 (PSLVbeta_UPD-PK2) was reduced to a single
    sequence after rethresholding and insufficient for model building.

    2 Ciona specific families: RF01187 (snoU83C) and RF01154 (snoU43C)
    are no longer in the snoRNA databases and no publication evidence
    for these ncRNA families can be found.

    1 family: RF01086 (LR-PK1) contained protein coding sequence and
    matched Pfam family PF00707 (IF3_C).

    4 families: RF00982 (mir-200), RF01217 (snoR72Y), RF01657
    (ceN74-2) and RF01949 (KCNQ1OT1_4 ) - had extensive overlaps with
    other families and have been merged into RF00241 (mir-8), RF00343
    (snoZ122), RF01656 (ceN72-3) and RF1947 (KCNQ1OT1_2) respectively.
    
(4) We have annotated the genome sequences for 3,110 unique
    species. These include 101 Eukaryotic, 1747 Bacterial, 123
    Archaeal and 1139 Viral genomes. This includes the Human GRCh37
    genome assembly.

(5) 4 new clans have been added CL00103 (SNORD11), CL00104
    (Hepadnavirus_epsilon), CL00105 (RyeA/RyeB) and CL00106
    (Csr_Rsm_clan). mir-2 has been removed from the clan CL00083
    according to Marco (2012) Evolution and function of the extended
    miR-2 microRNA family RNA Biol 9(3):242-8.

(6) We now provide mappings between Rfam and the ncRNA category of
    the non redundant database Refseq. For Rfam 11.0 we have generated
    21283 Rfam annotations to Refseqs (ncRNA) release 53. These
    mappings are from 860 Rfam families to 12334 different Refseq
    ncRNAs.
    
(7) Due to the increasing size of the nucleotide sequence databases
    and the resulting increase in the size of our alignments we are
    now unable to provide complete sequence alignments and trees for
    our 5 largest families tRNA (RF0005), SSU (RF00177, RF01959,
    RF0160) and ultra conserved element uc_338 (RF02271). For these
    families we have provided a full alignment that is composed of
    SEED and genome sequences only. The entries for these families in
    the files: Rfam.fasta, Rfam.full and Rfam_full.tree are based on
    these reduced genome alignments.  We do however provide a fasta
    file containing the complete WGS+STD annotations for each family
    on our ftp site (see below for release files). The number of
    sequences annotated in the reduced genome alignments and complete
    WGS_STD alignments:

       	       genome_alignment	   WGS_STD_alignment
    RF00005    298470		   2106268
    RF00177    7429		   744528
    RF01959    7394		   881056
    RF01960    425		   65901
    RF02271    857		   229907

(8) There are PDB mappings for 62 Rfam families covering 2287 unique
     PDB entries (2325 PDB chains). Our PDB mappings to tRNA and SSU
     sequences will be affected by the reduced alignments for these
     families.

(9) We have updated our family GO annotations and we now have 2750
    annotations associated with 1444 Rfam families. We also have 2218
    SO annotations and all families have at least one associated SO
    term.

(10) We now provide a graphical overview of the species distributions
     of a family using a "sunburst" representation. The new sunburst
     interface should be intuitive and provide a more flexible access
     point for users to select specific species or taxonomic groups of
     sequences from a family alignment.

(11) We have implemented a Biomart to enable users to perform more
     sophisticated and complex queries on Rfam data. The Biomart may
     be found at http://xfam-biomart.sanger.ac.uk

From release 10.1
 ----------------- 

(1) 528 new Rfam families have been added to Rfam. The new families
     include group II introns domains 1-4, Toxin-antitoxin systems,
     frame-shift elements, miRNAs, lncRNA models (eg. MEG3, MALAT1,
     MIAT, PRINS, Xist, TUG1, HSR-omega, Evf1, HOTAIR, KCNQ1OT1,
     SOX2OT, NEAT1, EGOT, H19, HOTAIRM1), and insertion element PYLIS
     and SECIS. Counts for the new families break down into the
     following types:
        
	* 134 	 Cis-reg;
        * 1 	 Cis-reg;leader;
        * 10 	 Cis-reg;riboswitch;
        * 4 	 Cis-reg;thermoregulator;
        * 111 	 Gene;
        * 7 	 Gene;antisense;
        * 2 	 Gene;ribozyme;
        * 2 	 Gene;rRNA;
        * 2 	 Gene;snRNA;
        * 79 	 Gene;snRNA;snoRNA;CD-box;
        * 68 	 Gene;snRNA;snoRNA;HACA-box;
        * 1 	 Gene;snRNA;splicing;
        * 98 	 Gene;sRNA;
        * 1 	 Gene;tRNA;
        * 8 	 Intron;

(2)  Family RF00120 (C0343) has been removed as there is strong
     evidence that this family is actually protein coding. See
     Washietl et al. (2011) RNAcode. 
(3)  Our Small Subunit (SSU) ribosomal model RF00177 has been split into
     SSU_rRNA_bacteria (RF00177), SSU_rRNA_archaea (RF01959) and
     SSU_rRNA_eukarya (RF01960). The improved longer models and alignments
     were derived from Robin Gutell's Comparative RNA web-resource
     (http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/).  The full alignments were built
     using ssu-align (http://selab.janelia.org/software.html).
(4)  Our Signal Recongition Particle (SRP) models have been rebuilt
     according to Rosenblad et al (2009) Kinship in the SRP RNA family
     RNA Biol.6:508-16. We now have 7 SRP families: Metazoa_SRP
     (RF00017), Bacteria_small_SRP (RF00169), Fungi_SRP (RF01502)
     Bacteria_large_SRP (RF01855), Plant_SRP (RF01855), Protozoa_SRP
     (RF01856), Archaea_SRP (RF01857). These new models should improve
     specificity and reduce pseduogene annotation.
(5)  3 new clans have been added U3 (CL00100), Cobalamin (CL00101) and
     group-II-D1D4 (CL00102). Membership of the clans tRNA (CL00001),
     RNaseP (CL00002) and SNORA62 (CL00040) have been updated. 
(6) There are genome mappings for 1,723 unique species. These include
     65 Eukaryotic, 840 Bacterial, 63 Archaeal and 755 Viral
     genomes. This includes the latest Human GRCh37 genome assembly.
(7)  There are PDB mappings for 50 Rfam families covering 795 unique
     PDB entries. The total number of PDB regions we cover is 2,340.
(8)  Several problematic microRNA families mir-544 (RF01045),
     mir-1302(RF00951), mir-1255(RF00994), mir-548 (RF01061), mir-649
     (RF01029), mir-562 (RF00998) and spliceosomal U13 (RF01210) were
     rethresholded to remove the excessive number of pseudogene
     annotations in the full alignments. This rethresholding along
     with the rebuilding of our SSU models have removed ~600,000
     annotations from Rfam.

From release 10.0
-----------------

(1)  The underlying sequence database (RFAMSEQ) has been updated,
     including the STD, WGS and ENV sections of EMBL 100. This database
     contains 170 Giga-bases of sequence, from more than 55 million
     sequences.
(2)  All the CMs have been built and searched using Infernal 1.0. Each
     family has been individually re-thresholded to accomodate the
     new models.
(3)  74 new families have been added. Including several S. pombe
     snoRNAs.
(4)  99 clans have been added to the database. This is another concept
     borrowed from Rfam's sister database, Pfam. Any families that are
     clearly homologous yet are too divergent to be aligned together
     are now explicitly connected (but not aligned) by inclusion in a
     clan. Each clan is annotated with references and evidence for
     homology.
(5)  There are genome mappings for 1,682 unique species. These include
     66 Eukaryotic, 827 Bacterial, 63 Archaeal and 726 Viral
     genomes. This includes the latest Human GRCh37 genome assembly.
(6)  There are PDB mappings for 43 Rfam families covering 633 unique
     PDB entries. The total number of PDB regions we cover is 2,425.
(7)  We have added a new set of alignments to the database (accessible
     via the website). These use sequence labels derived from species
     names rather than EMBL accessions and coordinates. In order to
     ensure that the provenance of each sequence can still be
     determined, the original labels have been included using "#=GS"
     tags. These are also available as HTML formatted files, produced
     using Ian Holmes' colorstock.pl script.
(8)  The secondary structure images have updated, now including 5' and
     3' labels. Structure images rendered by VARNA should also be
     available on the website.
(9)  Sequence ontology (SO) and gene ontology (GO) mappings have been
     generated for each family, thanks in large part to the work at
     fRNAdb.
(10) Updated links to the snoRNA orthological gene database (snOPY). 

From release 9.1
----------------

(1) 768 new rfam families have been added to Rfam. Counts for the new
    families break down into the following types:
        * 56   Cis-reg;
        * 5    Cis-reg;riboswitch;
        * 9    Gene;
        * 65   Gene;CRISPR;
        * 408  Gene;miRNA;
        * 1    Gene;rRNA;
        * 30   Gene;sRNA;
        * 144  Gene;snRNA;snoRNA;CD-box;
        * 50   Gene;snRNA;snoRNA;HACA-box;
(2) Genome mappings for 1,130 species are now avaiable from the browse
    page. These are complete with GFFs.
(3) Mappings to PDB tertiary structure are provided where applicable.

From release 9.0
----------------

(1) The underlying sequence database (RFAMSEQ) has been updated, now
    including WGS and ENV sections of EMBL 92.
(2) More than 370 families have been iterated, improving the species
    depth and sequence coverage of these models. Four families have
    been merged or killed. 
(3) A new catalyst-based website has been developed.
(4) Phylogenetic trees have been computed for each family.
(5) New secondary structure views are available.

large_family_files: For the 5 large families (RF00005, RF00177,
	RF01959, RF01960, RF02271) we have provided fasta files and
	associated data files for the FULL alignments containing all
	of the WGS and STD region annotations.  WGS_STD.align.fa.gz
	WGS_STD.scores.gz WGS_STD.out.list.gz WGS_STD.species.gz.

rfam_scan: rfam_scan.pl - a perl script for annotating
	sequence files on your local machine(s). Rfam.cm.gz and
	Rfam.fasta.gz are required, as is blast and bioperl.

6. GENOME ANNOTATION

The Rfam library of covariance models can be used to search sequences
(including whole genomes) for homologues to known non-coding RNAs, in
conjunction with the INFERNAL software.  This seems to work
particularly well for bacterial genomes, but there are some important
drawbacks to this approach for larger genomes, particularly
vertebrates.  The most important of these is our current inability to
computationally distinguish ncRNA derived pseudogenes and repeat
elements from real ncRNA genes.  If you intend to annotate large
eukaryotic genomes using Rfam you should first read the help pages on
the Rfam websites.

7. RFAMSEQ

RFAMSEQ is built from a subset of the EMBL nucleotide database
(available from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/release/).  We
use the STD and WGS data classes and exclude the SYN, PAT and TGN
divisions.
